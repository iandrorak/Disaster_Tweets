# Disaster Tweets Project

Name : Iandro Rakotondrandria

Data : Data files are in "src" folder

## Context :memo:

This project is from the Kaggle challenge [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)

* Competition Description

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.

The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.

## Goal :dart:

The challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. We worked on a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

**To set up :**

You must open the `disaster_tweets.ipynb` file in Google colab and load the `src` folder in your session

## Deliverable :mailbox_with_mail:

To complete this project, we produced a colab notebook with our models
